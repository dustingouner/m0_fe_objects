# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? I felt that I did pretty well on this assignment. I do need more time to grasp the overall concept. 

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? During my coding or immediately after. 

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? I have started to use stack overflow and referencing the MDN site more.
